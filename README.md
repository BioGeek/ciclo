# Ciclo
_A functional training loops library for JAX_

`ciclo` provides a set of utilities and abstractions to build complex training loops with any JAX framework. `ciclo` defines a set of building blocks that naturally compose together and scale up to build higher-level abstractions.

**Features**

‚úîÔ∏è Training utilities <br>
‚úîÔ∏è Loop language <br>
üß™ [experimental] Managed API (simplified training + parallelism) <br>
üß™ [experimental] Predefined Loops (e.g. `train_loop`, `test_loop`, `predict_loop`) <br>
üß™ [experimental] Framework support (predifined states + steps) <br>

<details><summary><b>Why Ciclo?</b></summary>


- In JAX functions are first-class citizens, instead of monolithic classes like `Model` or `Trainer` in other frameworks, there is a lot of benefit in a functional API for the training interface as well.<br>
- The JAX community is very focused on research, and as such there is a lot of interest in flexibility and control over the training loop. For this reason, `ciclo` provides some basic utilities and lets the user choose their desired level of abstraction.<br>
- Choosing the wrong abstractions can often break a framework, when this happens users often abandone the framework altogether. `ciclo` tries to avoid this by providing a set of utilities than can stand on their own so they can be useful even if the user decides to build their own training loop, but allows them to compose together and be used with ever increasing levels of abstraction. Ideally in the future a user should be able to pick anything from a Keras-like simplified experience to defining their own loops, or just coding the training loop manually and still have a good experience.<br><br>


<b>Comparison with other libraries</b><br><br>

- What about Elegy? Ciclo can be seen as the next version of Elegy that is built with better foundations. While Elegy started with a very rigid high-level API and gradually added more flexibility, Ciclo starts with low-level utilities and gradually adds more abstraction.<br>
- What about `clu`? Ciclo took from inspiration from `clu` and rather than compete with it, Ciclo aims to complement it. At the lowest level they both compose by virtue of just providing utilities that work with JAX, however, whenever possible Ciclo's abstractions provide support for `clu`'s utilities e.g. `loop` supports `clu`'s `PeriodicAction`s.<br>

## Installation

```bash
pip install ciclo
```

## Status
Ciclo is still in early development, the API is subject to change, expect things to break. If you are interested in contributing, please reach out.
  
## Utilities

* Time tracking
* Logging
* Schedules
* Callbacks
* Loops
* Parallelism (managed API)
* Predefined States (framework support)

## Quick Start
The `loop` function serves as a mini-language for defining training loops as a composition of functions. The tasks dictionary lets you express the desired behavior of the loop as a composition of schedules and callbacks.

```python
@jax.jit
def train_step(state, batch):
    ... # update state
    logs = ciclo.logs()
    ... # add logs
    return logs, state

total_steps = 10_000
state = create_state() # initial state

state, history, elapsed = ciclo.loop(
    state, # Pytree
    dataset, # Iterable[Batch]
    # Dict[Schedule, List[Callback]]
    {
        ciclo.every(1): [train_step],
        ciclo.every(steps=1000): [ciclo.checkpoint(f"logdir/model")],
        ciclo.every(1): [ciclo.keras_bar(total=total_steps)],
    },
    stop=total_steps, # stop: Optional[int | Period]
)
```

### train_loop

If you need a more traditional (Keras-like) training loop, you can use `train_loop` will take care of some of the boilerplate for you without loosing any flexibility. 

```python
@jax.jit
def test_step(state, batch):
    ... # update state
    logs = ciclo.logs()
    ... # add logs
    return logs, state

state, history, elapsed = ciclo.train_loop(
    state, # 
    train_dataset, # Iterable[Batch]
    # Dict[Schedule, List[Callback]]
    {
        ciclo.train_step: [train_step], # named schedules
        ciclo.test_step: [test_step], # named schedules
        ciclo.every(20): [some_callback], # regular schedules also supported
    },
    test_dataset=lambda: make_test_dataset(), # lazy test dataset definition
    epoch_duration=steps_per_epoch,
    callbacks=[
        # callback self-registration
        ciclo.keras_bar(total=total_steps), # runs on ciclo.on_train_batch_end
        ciclo.checkpoint(f"logdir/model"),  # runs on ciclo.on_epoch_end
    ],
    stop=total_steps,
)
```

### Manual Iteration
Each of Ciclo's utilities provide simple APIs so you can use them standalone if you want to build your own training loop.

```python
call_checkpoint = ciclo.every(steps=1000) # Schedule
checkpoint = ciclo.checkpoint(f"logdir/model") # Callback
keras_bar = ciclo.keras_bar(total=total_steps) # Callback
history = ciclo.history() # History
# (Elapsed, Batch)
for elapsed, batch in ciclo.elapse(train_dataset, stop=total_steps):
    logs = ciclo.logs() # Logs
    # update logs and state
    logs.updates, state = train_step(state, batch)
    # periodically checkpoint state
    if call_checkpoint(elapsed):
        checkpoint(elapsed, state) # serialize state

    keras_bar(elapsed, logs) # update progress bar
    history.commit(elapsed, logs) # commit logs to history
```
